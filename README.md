# Event-Based-Eye-Tracking-and-Blink-No-Blink-Detection
An event-based camera captures asynchronous spikes of eye motion, which are binned into spatio-temporal voxel grids and fed to a lightweight spiking CNN. The network simultaneously classifies blink vs. no-blink and regresses gaze centroid with low latency and high temporal resolution, making it ideal for neuromorphic sensing applications
